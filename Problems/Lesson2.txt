10) This is obvious because we are passing our "n" as an unsigned data type, which can not
hold negative values. The for has the condition "i <= n - 1", so when "n" is initialized with
a 0, the "n-1" does not equal to -1, it actually goes all the way around to the maximum positive value.
That totally misrepresents the actual number of elements of the two vectors, trying to access the total
range of representable positions by that "n". That provokes the segmentation fault.

Least intrusive fix (changing the condition): 

float dot_product(float *a, float *b, unsigned n){
	int i;
	float result = 0.0;
	for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) result += a[i]*b[i];
	return result;
}
