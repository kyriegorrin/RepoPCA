LESSON 1
--------

1) To get the maximum speed-up, we have to assume that 30% of execution time to be optimized to the point of being instantaneous.
With that being said, the speedup would be 1/(1 - 0.3) = 1.43.

2) Without applying Ahmdal's Law, we know that a reduction of half the execution time is a speedup of 2.
Reducing the execution time to a quarter of the initial time would be a speedup of 4. Following this logic, we end up
with an eight of the execution time in order to have a speedup of 8 (it would be about a 12.5% of the original time).

3) //NOT ENTIRELY SURE, IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE TO DO MORE SPECIALIZED NUMBER CRUNCHING
Assuming a normal distribution, we can see that the worst case scenario for both versions would be 4.5s, 
while the best case scenario is 3.5s (the mean time of the second code) for the original code and 2.5s for the new one.
Knowing this, it would be safe to assume that the second version is better because most of the time it would be performing
as well or better than the first version.

If they have the same behavior with 30 executions, the answer would be the same as before.
