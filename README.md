<h1>RepoPCA</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>This repository is for storing and working with all the necessary code and problems used in the PCA course.</p>

<p>Note: the code used for the challenge evaluation will probably not be here because I am a selfish soab, so don't waste your time looking in here.</p>
